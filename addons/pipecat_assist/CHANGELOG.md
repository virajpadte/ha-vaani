# Changelog

## 0.1.93

- Renamed the add-on's display name and the Home Assistant integration to
  **Vaani** (integration domain `sarvam_assist` -> `vaani`; Lovelace card
  `sarvam-assist-card` -> `vaani-card`). The add-on's slug intentionally
  stayed `sarvam_assist` so it updates in place with no reinstall and no
  settings loss; only the Home Assistant integration needs a one-time
  re-add. Replaced the "Sarvam Assist" wordmark with "Vaani" across the
  icon/logo, UI, and docs - "Sarvam AI" remains as the underlying provider
  name throughout, since that hasn't changed.

## 0.1.92

- Replaced the free-text Language field (which required typing a Sarvam
  BCP-47 code by hand) with a dropdown of Sarvam's verified supported
  languages - English plus 10 Indic languages. Added a matching
  `/api/assist/sarvam/languages` endpoint and a config-load repair that
  resets an unsupported saved language code to the default.
- Scoped the Marathi gender verb-form rule to only apply when Language is
  set to Marathi - it no longer asserts Marathi grammar for other
  configured languages. Generalized Marathi-only wording in the README/DOCS
  to reflect the full supported-language list.
- Replaced the add-on and Home Assistant integration's icon/logo with
  original artwork. They still showed the upstream Pipecat Assist cat
  mascot and "Pipecat Assist" wordmark after the rename to Sarvam Assist.

## 0.1.91

- Fixed TTS producing no audio when the saved voice belongs to a different
  bulbul model than the one configured (e.g. a bulbul:v2-only speaker saved
  against bulbul:v3) - confirmed live via Sarvam's own API rejecting the
  mismatched pairing with HTTP 400. The voices endpoint now filters by the
  integration's configured TTS model, and a config-load repair resets any
  already-saved incompatible pairing to a valid speaker automatically.

## 0.1.90

- Renamed the add-on and Home Assistant integration to **Sarvam Assist**
  (integration domain `pipecat_assist` -> `sarvam_assist`; Lovelace card
  `pipecat-assist-card` -> `sarvam-assist-card`). Existing Sarvam API
  key/models/voice/language and flow instructions/greeting carry over
  automatically on upgrade.
- Removed every provider except Sarvam STT/LLM/TTS: Gemini (Live and Cloud),
  OpenAI (Realtime and Cloud), Anthropic, AWS Bedrock and Nova Sonic,
  Deepgram, Soniox, Speechmatics, Cartesia, Gradium, ElevenLabs, Google Cloud
  TTS, image generation, Pipecat Flows, and the free-form pipeline builder.
  Replaced the old Ollama/local-runtime/OpenAI-compatible options with one
  consolidated "Local" Model-step option.
- Replaced the LLM-indirected web search with a direct Tavily search-API
  tool call - no extra LLM is used to do the searching.
- Added a Sarvam bulbul speaker-gender map and an automatic Marathi
  first-person verb-form system rule based on the selected voice.
- Extended the exposed-device-list system prompt with explicit "turn
  off/on all lights" guidance (domain-wide turn-off, per-device turn-on,
  matching switch entities named lamp/light, confirming what changed).
- Replaced the three-tab pipeline builder/integrations UI with one fixed
  settings page for the fixed Sarvam pipeline.

## 0.1.80

- Coalesce streaming user and assistant transcript tokens into cumulative
  phrases before sending them to ESPHome satellites, avoiding word-by-word UI
  redraws while keeping live captions responsive.
- Deliver a pending final assistant phrase together with the terminal or
  follow-up phase transition so short unpunctuated replies cannot lose either
  their final text or their conversation state.
- Prefer higher-quality assistant transcript sources when overlapping RTVI
  observers publish the same turn.

## 0.1.79

- Seed the Gemini Live context for ESPHome satellites without generating an
  unsolicited greeting, so the service accepts streamed microphone PCM from
  the first wake-word turn.
- Use local Silero VAD as the sole turn detector for Gemini ESPHome sessions,
  avoiding competing server-side VAD boundaries and duplicate interruptions.
- Suppress duplicate pipeline interrupt and assistant transcript events sent by
  overlapping Pipecat observers.
- Treat scheduled Gemini Live session renewal after a stable connection as a
  reconnect instead of accumulating it toward the fatal failure limit.
- Keep multi-window PCM level diagnostics available at debug log level.

## 0.1.78

- Add local Silero VAD turn boundaries for Gemini Live ESPHome satellites so
  streamed microphone audio can reliably open and close user turns.
- Avoid loading the Smart Turn analyzer for the realtime ESPHome path, keeping
  turn detection deterministic and reducing startup overhead.
- Log one low-overhead PCM level summary at the start of each ESPHome
  conversation to distinguish silent microphone input from backend VAD issues.

## 0.1.77

- Provision authenticated `va_pipecat` WebSocket endpoints automatically
  through the native ESPHome API, without exposing the endpoint as an entity.
- Discover compatible satellites through Home Assistant and periodically
  re-provision them after device, add-on, or Home Assistant restarts.
- Keep an explicit host override and the generated endpoint as a manual
  fallback for networks where automatic address discovery is insufficient.

## 0.1.76

- Add the product-ready ESPHome `va_pipecat` component and an authenticated,
  versioned raw-PCM WebSocket endpoint.
- Keep a warm Pipecat pipeline for wake-word turns, full-duplex barge-in,
  transcripts, deterministic follow-up listening, and terminal conversation
  states.
- Expose satellite timing and jitter-buffer controls in Runtime settings.
- Preserve `thinking` while Home Assistant tools are running and avoid an
  unsolicited greeting when the ESPHome satellite connects.

## 0.1.75

- Resize Pipecat Assist custom component brand assets to Home Assistant Brands
  dimensions so the local Brands Proxy API can serve the integration icon and
  logo correctly.

## 0.1.74

- Restore stable widget transcription handling while keeping backend RTVI
  streaming STT events available.
- Prefer cleaned assistant output/transcription events over raw LLM token
  deltas in the add-on assistant and Lovelace card.
- Keep browser SpeechRecognition as the primary widget transcript source when
  available, filtering server-side interim STT deltas to avoid random spacing.

## 0.1.73

- Make RTVI transcript and assistant text streams explicit for realtime
  WebRTC sessions.
- Prefer live LLM text over later TTS text in the assistant card, reducing
  duplicated or late assistant captions.
- Treat server-side Pipecat transcriptions as the source of truth and keep the
  browser SpeechRecognition transcript as a fallback only.

## 0.1.72

- Prevent composed realtime pipelines from selecting providers that are only
  available through HA Assist bridges, such as Gemini Cloud as STT.
- Add backend runtime preflight validation for WebRTC offers so invalid
  STT/LLM/TTS combinations return a clear configuration error instead of a
  Starlette/AnyIO cancel-scope traceback.
- Fix Gemini Cloud model listing so STT no longer shows text-generation models,
  and make Lovelace card offer errors display the server `detail` text.

## 0.1.71

- Sanitize MCP JSON Schemas before exposing them as Pipecat/Gemini tools, so
  richer HA MCP Server add-on schemas using keywords such as `propertyNames` or
  `exclusiveMinimum` do not crash Gemini Live.
- Keep MCP tool routing unchanged while simplifying unsupported validation
  metadata for realtime model function calling.

## 0.1.70

- Auto-detect the Home Assistant MCP Server add-on through the Supervisor API,
  using the add-on's generated secret URL without asking for a Bearer token.
- Add per-integration MCP testing for the HA MCP Server add-on and clear old
  saved tokens for that integration during config migration.
- Remove redundant integration selectors from Web Search and Tools pipeline
  steps; their providers are configured globally in Integrations.

## 0.1.69

- End realtime and HA Assist conversations when the user clearly closes the
  session, including Polish phrases such as "dziekuje, koniec".
- Add a model instruction for graceful final replies without follow-up
  questions when a conversation is ending.
- Delay WebRTC shutdown until the assistant's final TTS turn finishes, with a
  fallback timeout for providers that do not emit speech-stop events.

## 0.1.68

- Expose Pipecat Assist as a Home Assistant AI Tasks image-generation provider.
- Add Google Imagen and fal Image Generation integrations with dedicated API
  key/model configuration and a Runtime image-provider selector.
- Encode Pipecat image frames into HA-compatible image bytes with MIME type and
  metadata, and document why Moondream is reserved for future vision tasks.

## 0.1.67

- Replace the add-on Assistant voice test with the same Pipecat Assist card
  experience used in Lovelace: transcript stream, smooth scrolling, status
  badge, wave visualizer, and clean stop behavior.
- Move "Edit active pipeline" into the top bar before the theme toggle so the
  Assistant tab stays focused on the conversation card.

## 0.1.66

- Smooth Lovelace transcript scrolling so new lines no longer reanimate the
  whole transcript.
- Add English and Polish Lovelace card labels based on the Home Assistant UI
  language, including the Polish greeting.
- Keep only the wave visualizer, move it back to the bottom of the card, make
  Connected the green state, and clear transcripts when a conversation stops.

## 0.1.65

- Replace the Lovelace card transcript renderer with a streaming message model
  inspired by `voice-satellite-card-integration`: in-place DOM updates,
  requestAnimationFrame coalescing, fade-tail text, and smooth transcript
  scrolling.
- Move the card status into a compact badge next to the title, with green
  Ready state and animated Connecting dots.
- Let transcript text overlay the voice animation while keeping the card height
  fixed and removing the secondary technical status lines.

## 0.1.64

- Keep the Lovelace card at a fixed height while transcript text scrolls inside
  the individual user and assistant bubbles.
- Prefer higher-quality final assistant captions over fragmented streaming
  partials to avoid repeated or split words in the card transcript.
- Route browser speech-recognition captions through the same echo filter as
  RTVI captions so assistant audio is less likely to appear as user text.

## 0.1.63

- Keep the Lovelace card height stable by scrolling longer transcripts inside
  the card with a fade at the edges.
- Add Lovelace card options for compact mode, idle animation, accent color, and
  WebRTC audio buffer hinting.
- Blend the visualizer canvas into the card background so the top edge is no
  longer visibly cut off.

## 0.1.62

- Suppress delayed assistant transcript fragments in the Lovelace card so
  higher-level bot responses are not followed by repeated starts or middle
  chunks from lower-level LLM/TTS streams.
- Keep the fuller assistant caption when a later higher-priority event only
  repeats a fragment of the same turn.

## 0.1.61

- Pause browser-local Lovelace card speech recognition while the assistant is
  speaking, then resume it after the assistant turn ends, so TTS audio is not
  captured as user transcript text.

## 0.1.60

- Fix Lovelace card RTVI transcript routing so `user-llm-text` is displayed as
  user text instead of being misclassified as an assistant LLM response.
- Prefer higher-quality bot transcript events (`bot-output`/`bot-transcription`)
  over lower-level LLM/TTS token streams within the same assistant turn to avoid
  duplicated responses.
- Add echo suppression for browser-local speech recognition when it hears the
  assistant audio.
- Normalize short transcript chunks with safer spacing so words like "czym moge"
  are not merged into one word.

## 0.1.59

- Fix Lovelace card transcript merging so local browser transcripts and Pipecat
  data-channel events no longer repeat the same user or assistant text.
- Normalize transcript spacing around punctuation and streamed text chunks.
- Replace the static Lovelace card wave decoration with a Web Audio canvas
  visualizer inspired by JSVoice's analyser-based approach.

## 0.1.58

- Force-refresh existing Lovelace card instances after the new module loads,
  including cards nested in Home Assistant shadow DOM.
- Add an unobtrusive card version marker so stale frontend assets are
  immediately visible during troubleshooting.
- Update and deduplicate Pipecat Assist Lovelace resources registered by the
  custom component.

## 0.1.57

- Fixed the Lovelace card upgrade path so a newly loaded card module patches an
  already registered older custom element instead of leaving the old UI active.
- Added browser-side speech recognition in the Lovelace card when available, so
  live user transcription and end-of-conversation phrases work even when the
  provider does not send transcript events over the data channel.
- Treat empty/no-speech HA Assist STT turns as a clean empty result instead of
  surfacing a `speech-to-text failed` error after conversation shutdown.

## 0.1.56

- Added a Home Assistant AI Tasks entity backed by the selected Pipecat Assist
  text pipeline.
- Added a separate HA MCP Server add-on integration, custom MCP server
  integrations, and multi-server MCP routing with prefixed tool names.
- Updated the Lovelace card with live transcript slots, a richer voice UI, and
  end-of-conversation detection.
- Renamed HA Assist bridge logs to Pipecat Live Bridge, tightened composed VAD
  stop timing, and applied ElevenLabs speed to HA Assist TTS.
- Simplified integration settings by moving enable/delete controls into the
  header, hiding built-in deletes, and normalizing Gemini model names.

## 0.1.55

- Expanded the Home Assistant Assist bridge so explicit STT/TTS pipeline steps
  can use Soniox, Deepgram, Speechmatics, Gradium, OpenAI, Gemini, Cartesia,
  Google Cloud TTS, ElevenLabs, and local runtime integrations without silent
  provider fallback.
- Added HA Assist conversation support for Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, and Azure
  OpenAI LLM steps, including MCP/web-search tool calling where the provider
  supports tool use.
- HA Assist now surfaces Gemini Live and streaming STT bridge failures as
  provider errors instead of silently retrying through a different path.
- Renamed Google Cloud TTS HTTP to a normal one-shot synthesis option and
  limited Web Search provider selection to the LLM providers implemented by
  the backend.

## 0.1.54

- Added Speechmatics to the Home Assistant Assist STT bridge so composed
  pipelines with a Speechmatics STT step no longer fall back to OpenAI Cloud.
- Added a Speechmatics realtime WebSocket STT bridge for HA Assist streaming
  microphone input, including partial and final transcript handling.

## 0.1.53

- Added a Home Assistant frontend compatibility guard that fills a missing
  `assist_pipeline/run` STT sample rate when the web Assist dialog sends
  `sample_rate: null`, preventing the Core validation error before Pipecat
  Assist STT is called.
- The Lovelace card now tears down active WebRTC audio on page unload or when
  the card is removed from the dashboard DOM, reducing the chance that a stale
  microphone session interferes with Home Assistant Assist in the same browser.

## 0.1.52

- Stabilized mobile Lovelace audio by switching the WebRTC Opus offer back to
  mono fullband voice settings with a lower bitrate and stronger audio-session
  cleanup between calls.
- Disabled token-level TTS aggregation for ElevenLabs because it can feed the
  provider tiny text fragments and cause choppy playback; existing ElevenLabs
  integrations are repaired back to sentence aggregation.

## 0.1.51

- Tuned Lovelace card and add-on voice test WebRTC offers for fuller Opus
  playback by advertising fullband/high-bitrate Opus parameters.
- Added a background Home Assistant Assist warmup after add-on startup and
  configuration saves to pre-cache MCP tools and pre-open the Gemini Live setup
  path before the first Assist turn.

## 0.1.50

- Fixed composed WebRTC sessions with Speechmatics STT by passing the active
  session language into the Pipecat Speechmatics service instead of leaving it
  at the provider default English setting.
- Lovelace card and the add-on voice test now send a session language with the
  WebRTC offer, using the card config, Home Assistant language, or browser
  language as available.

## 0.1.49

- Fixed composed Home Assistant Assist STT selection so OpenAI Cloud
  transcription models such as `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` use the stable buffered
  transcription endpoint instead of being incorrectly routed through the
  realtime STT bridge.
- Added Home Assistant Assist STT stream logs with selected provider, mode,
  received audio size, and transcript fingerprint to make composed pipeline
  audio issues visible in add-on logs.

## 0.1.48

- Home Assistant Assist conversation responses now keep
  `continue_conversation=true` for successful turns across all Pipecat Assist
  conversation bridge paths, so the HA frontend can resume listening after TTS
  playback ends.
- The custom component now keeps continuous conversation enabled for successful
  add-on responses and disables it only when the add-on returns an error.

## 0.1.47

- Reduced Home Assistant Assist latency for Gemini Live bridge turns by
  completing the bridge on Gemini Live `generationComplete` instead of waiting
  for `turnComplete`, which can include the model's simulated realtime playback
  delay.
- Pipecat Live Bridge responses now set `continue_conversation=true`
  so Home Assistant frontends that support continuous conversation can resume
  listening after the answer.
- Added the Gemini Live completion reason to HA Assist bridge logs.

## 0.1.46

- Fixed the raw Gemini Live WebSocket setup payload used by the Home Assistant
  Assist bridge. `responseModalities`, `speechConfig`, and `maxOutputTokens`
  are now sent under `generationConfig`, matching the Live API schema.
- Omitted unsupported raw Live `thinkingConfig` fields from the HA Assist
  bridge setup to avoid `Unknown name` setup failures.

## 0.1.45

- Added a Gemini Live turn bridge for Home Assistant Assist audio sessions.
  When the active pipeline is Gemini Live and Home Assistant sends mono 16-bit
  PCM audio, STT starts a Gemini Live turn and caches the resulting transcript,
  assistant text, and Live audio for the following Conversation and TTS calls.
- Added Gemini Live MCP tool-call forwarding in the HA Assist bridge so smart
  home requests can still use Home Assistant MCP instead of dropping to a
  tool-less audio-only path.
- HA Assist TTS now reuses Gemini Live audio for bridged turns instead of
  synthesizing a second response through Gemini Cloud TTS.
- The Home Assistant STT entity now advertises WAV/PCM only, so HA Assist
  consistently provides a stream format that can be forwarded to Live APIs.

## 0.1.44

- Fixed provider-specific default TTS voices so Gemini Cloud uses the Gemini
  voice fallback instead of the OpenAI `marin` fallback when no voice is set.
- Added TTS synthesis logs with provider, model, voice, and synthesis duration
  to make slow HA Assist voice responses easier to diagnose.

## 0.1.43

- Reuse HA Assist TTS prefetches even when Home Assistant requests a different
  preferred audio format than the prefetch task used.
- Add timing logs for HA Assist Conversation and TTS so add-on logs show cache
  hits, prefetch age, TTS wait time, and total request time.

## 0.1.42

- Updated the default Gemini TTS model to `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`
  and migrate saved default Gemini TTS settings to the current model.
- Added Gemini TTS retry and model fallback handling so HA Assist TTS prefetch
  does not fall back to a second slow on-demand synthesis after transient
  `Gemini did not return audio` responses.

## 0.1.41

- Added a WebSocket-based Home Assistant STT bridge so HA Assist microphone
  audio is forwarded to the add-on while it is still being captured.
- Added streaming STT paths for OpenAI realtime transcription and Deepgram,
  with buffered fallback for other configured pipelines such as Gemini Live or
  Gemini Cloud.
- Added best-effort TTS prefetch after HA Assist conversation responses so the
  following HA TTS request can reuse already-started synthesis when possible.

## 0.1.40

- Added early silence detection to the Home Assistant STT bridge so classic HA
  Assist audio requests do not wait for Home Assistant to close a long stream
  before transcription starts.
- Fixed HA Assist text conversations for OpenAI Cloud composed pipelines by
  choosing a provider-compatible model from the active LLM integration instead
  of reusing stale Gemini flow defaults.
- Replaced the default Gemini text fallback with `gemini-2.5-flash` and
  migrated saved `gemini-3.5-flash` defaults.

## 0.1.39

- Fixed Lovelace WebRTC card playback by preserving the remote audio stream
  across status rerenders and adding the same RTVI keepalive ping used by the
  add-on voice test.
- Added a browser-blocked playback recovery button for cases where the browser
  requires an extra tap before audio can play.

## 0.1.38

- Added safe provider error handling for HA Assist STT, TTS, and conversation
  calls so transient provider failures such as Gemini 503 no longer crash the
  add-on or leak request URLs into tracebacks.
- Added retries for HA Assist STT/TTS provider calls.
- Improved the Home Assistant conversation entity to read text error responses
  from the add-on instead of reporting them as unreachable JSON decode errors.

## 0.1.37

- Fixed HA Assist STT/TTS failures when the active pipeline is speech-to-speech
  and has no separate STT or TTS steps.
- Added automatic HA Assist bridge fallbacks for enabled compatible
  integrations, including Gemini STT/TTS using the existing Google API key.
- Replaced unhandled add-on RuntimeErrors for missing HA Assist bridge
  integrations with clear HTTP errors.

## 0.1.36

- Fixed the classic Home Assistant Assist bridge by wrapping raw PCM microphone
  audio into a valid WAV file before sending it to cloud STT providers.
- Changed HA Assist TTS output to default to MP3 and honor Home Assistant's
  preferred output format, avoiding unnecessary playback conversion failures.

## 0.1.35

- Automatically register the Lovelace card as a dashboard resource in storage
  mode so it appears in the card picker under custom cards.
- Added cache-busting for the Lovelace card module and made the card module
  safe to load more than once.

## 0.1.34

- Fixed Home Assistant Assist language filtering by advertising all languages
  for the conversation entity and broad STT/TTS language support including
  Polish, so Pipecat Assist can be selected for Polish and other HA assistant
  languages.

## 0.1.33

- Fixed Lovelace card static asset registration on Home Assistant versions
  where `async_register_static_paths` is exposed on `hass.http` instead of as a
  module-level helper.

## 0.1.32

- Auto-detect the Pipecat Assist add-on through the Home Assistant Supervisor
  API and prefill the add-on URL in the custom component setup form while
  keeping the field editable.

## 0.1.31

- Added authenticated Home Assistant proxy endpoints for the Lovelace card, so
  dashboard YAML no longer needs an add-on Ingress token.
- Changed the Lovelace card to use the active add-on pipeline by default
  instead of sending a flow ID.
- Simplified new custom component setup to only ask for the add-on URL.

## 0.1.30

- Automatically load the Lovelace card module when the Pipecat Assist custom
  component is installed, so users no longer need to add a dashboard resource
  manually.

## 0.1.29

- Added visible pipeline steps for Session Memory and Web Search, including a
  Web Search announcement switch.
- Let Web Search choose a cloud LLM provider instead of assuming OpenAI; OpenAI
  Responses web search and Gemini Google Search grounding are supported.
- Added Polish UI translations with automatic locale detection and moved the
  dark-mode control to an icon button in the top bar.
- Added Home Assistant STT and TTS entities plus a Lovelace WebRTC card for
  Pipecat Assist.
- Fixed the active pipeline badge CSS and relabeled Google Cloud TTS HTTP as a
  fallback provider.

## 0.1.28

- Added Web Search as a separate integration and optional LLM tool for
  pipelines.
- Added short-lived per-client session memory and configurable MCP tool schema
  caching in Runtime settings.
- Split Google Cloud TTS into HTTP and Streaming integrations, with chunking
  controls for compatible streaming TTS providers.
- Wired composed pipelines to support local Web Search tools together with Home
  Assistant MCP tools.
- Tightened VAD semantics so removing the VAD step disables local/provider turn
  detection configuration instead of leaving a hidden pipeline behavior.
- Updated docs for Gemini Live, composed realtime latency, Web Search, MCP
  cache, and session memory.

## 0.1.27

- Cleaned the pipeline editor inspector so step-specific controls are shown
  only for the selected step.
- Moved language and speech speed defaults from pipeline editing into
  integration runtime defaults and wired them into provider setup.
- Added hover delete controls to pipeline step tiles and fixed the active
  pipeline badge layout.

## 0.1.26

- Added first-run Gemini Live setup guidance above the assistant voice test
  when no configured pipeline is ready to run.
- Changed the default ElevenLabs voice to `Xb7hH8MSUJpSbSDYk0k2` and migrated
  saved defaults that still used the old built-in voice.

## 0.1.25

- Moved composed realtime turn detection into an explicit VAD processor before
  STT so cloud STT providers receive end-of-speech signals and can finalize
  transcripts.
- Replaced the deprecated incomplete-turn LLM filter in composed pipelines with
  a cascade speech-timeout turn strategy.
- Added the Turn detection step to composed presets and migrated existing
  composed pipelines that were missing it.

## 0.1.24

- Split Gemini configuration into Google Gemini Live for speech-to-speech
  pipelines and Google Gemini Cloud for composed LLM and Pipecat Flow
  pipelines.
- Migrated existing composed Gemini LLM steps to Google Gemini Cloud and
  replaced invalid Gemini STT/TTS steps with supported cloud defaults.
- Fixed composed pipeline presets so they no longer assign Gemini Live to STT
  or TTS steps.

## 0.1.23

- Fixed pipeline validation and integration dropdowns so OpenAI Realtime is
  valid for speech-to-speech pipelines and OpenAI Cloud is used for composed
  STT, LLM, TTS, and Pipecat Flow pipelines.
- Migrated existing saved "OpenAI" integrations to the "OpenAI Realtime" name
  and kept the separate OpenAI Cloud profile for non-realtime model settings.
- Fixed the active pipeline badge alignment in the pipeline editor.

## 0.1.22

- Split OpenAI configuration into OpenAI Realtime for speech-to-speech
  pipelines and OpenAI Cloud for composed STT, LLM, and TTS pipelines.
- Added capability-specific OpenAI defaults for transcription, text models,
  TTS models, and voices, with migration for existing composed pipelines.
- Fixed OpenAI composed runtime failures caused by sending text models to STT
  and by passing `max_tokens: null` to OpenAI chat completions.

## 0.1.21

- Replaced the Pipecat Flows iframe/JSON workflow with an embedded visual
  composer that stores Pipecat Flows Editor-compatible nodes, edges, messages,
  functions, post-actions, and MCP tool bindings.
- Added built-in filtered flow examples, including the official minimal and
  food ordering examples plus a Home Assistant MCP pizza-ordering starter.
- Fixed pipeline action button alignment, improved danger-button contrast in
  dark mode, and defaulted pipeline language fields to `en`.
- Taught the runtime to execute the official Pipecat Flows JSON shape in
  addition to the earlier Home Assistant flow shape.

## 0.1.20

- Fixed browser voice tests hanging on "Connecting audio" after the add-on
  started applying Pipecat's ESP32 SDP munging globally.
- Added WebRTC ICE connection state handling and a visible connection timeout
  so failed audio setup is reported in the Assistant panel instead of spinning
  indefinitely.

## 0.1.19

- Separated active pipeline selection from opening a pipeline for editing, with
  an explicit Set active action and active checkmark on pipeline cards.
- Reworked Pipelines, Integrations, Assistant, and Runtime navigation into
  contextual list/detail screens and removed redundant right columns.
- Removed unsupported Pipecat Flow steps from speech-to-speech presets while
  keeping a disabled palette tile to explain availability.
- Added an official Pipecat Flows Editor surface with JSON import/export and a
  pizza example loader for composed realtime pipelines.
- Added visible MCP test results, a readable Home Assistant MCP call history,
  and simplified automatic Supervisor MCP status.
- Removed the exposed ESP32 mode add-on option; the runner now starts with ESP32
  SmallWebRTC compatibility enabled.
- Improved dark mode contrast, microphone-permission errors, and the assistant
  voice test surface.

## 0.1.18

- Reworked the add-on UI into a product-style flow with Assistant-first
  validation, a pipeline list before pipeline editing, contextual step
  inspectors, and a nested Pipecat Flow composer.
- Moved Home Assistant MCP testing and reset controls into the Home Assistant
  MCP integration, with Automatic, Manual, and Error status labels.
- Added per-integration reset-to-default actions, removed technical ID/kind
  fields from integration forms, and moved save buttons under the edited
  settings.
- Removed duplicated MCP, voice test, and satellite-secret controls from
  Runtime. Runtime now focuses on audio debug and add-on-managed facts.
- Added dark mode, step/pipeline color coding, pipeline validation, drag/drop
  step insertion, hover/click button motion, optional no-greeting behavior, and
  a Voice UI Kit-inspired assistant test surface.

## 0.1.17

- Added composed realtime Pipecat runtime support for STT -> LLM -> TTS
  pipelines alongside Gemini Live, OpenAI Realtime, and AWS Nova Sonic
  speech-to-speech profiles.
- Added pipeline presets inspired by the Pipecat demo, including Soniox,
  Deepgram, Speechmatics, OpenAI, Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Cartesia, Gradium,
  Google Cloud TTS, and ElevenLabs combinations.
- Added Pipecat Flow configuration for composed realtime pipelines with visual
  nodes, transition functions, JSON schemas, and optional Home Assistant MCP
  tool calls.
- Reworked the web UI around an Assistant-first screen, contextual pipeline
  editing, grouped preset cards, integration-specific settings, locked saved
  secrets, and provider model dropdowns where model APIs are available.

## 0.1.16

- Added optional audio debug capture for realtime voice sessions, writing
  separate input and output WAV files under `/data/audio-debug`.
- Added Runtime controls to enable audio capture, set retention, download
  captured WAV files, and clear stored debug sessions.

## 0.1.15

- Fixed OpenAI Realtime sessions inheriting Gemini voices such as `Charon`,
  which caused `session.audio.output.voice` validation errors.
- Clear invalid MCP URL overrides so the add-on falls back to the Supervisor
  MCP URL instead of trying values without `http://` or `https://`.

## 0.1.14

- Fixed OpenAI Realtime pipelines that could inherit a Gemini Live model after
  switching templates or integrations in the UI.
- Added runtime fallback and startup logging for the selected realtime
  provider/model before a voice session starts.

## 0.1.13

- Removed the Home Assistant MCP OAuth flow from the add-on backend and UI.
- Added a Runtime button that resets Home Assistant MCP settings to the
  Supervisor-backed defaults.
- Migrated saved runtime configuration to drop stale OAuth token fields.

## 0.1.12

- Prefer the Home Assistant Supervisor token for MCP access inside the add-on.
  OAuth is now only a fallback for custom/out-of-Supervisor setups.
- Updated Runtime copy so OAuth is no longer presented as required when the
  Supervisor token is available.

## 0.1.11
